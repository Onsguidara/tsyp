## 📌 Project Overview

An Autonomous AI System for Marine Monitoring, detecting ivasive species using deep learning models.
The Aqua Sentinel system is designed as an end-to-end
monitoring solution in which data acquisition, artificial in-
telligence processing, and user interaction are tightly inte-
grated. The outputs generated by the detection and tracking
modules are delivered to a user-facing mobile application,
named MarineGuard, which serves as the primary interface
for visualization, alerts, and data explor .
